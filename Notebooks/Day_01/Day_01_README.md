âœ‹ Please feel free to make suggestions. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: [100-Days-of-Artificial-Intelligence](https://github.com/natnew/100-Days-of-Artificial-Intelligence)
2. Navigate to the project directory on your local machine.
3. Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies (optional but recommended).
4. Activate the virtual environment (if created).
5. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python (version 3.6 or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [Keras(version 2.3 or higher)](https://pypi.org/project/keras/)
- [OpenCV (version 4.2 or higher)](https://opencv.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Install Python:

1. Set Up the Dataset:

* Download or gather the dataset of cat and dog images.
* Organize the images into separate directories for training and testing, with each category (cat and dog) in its respective folder.

> train/ <br>
> cat/ <br>
> cat1.jpg <br>
> cat2.jpg <br>
> ... <br>


> test/ <br>
> cat/ <br>
> cat1.jpg <br>
> cat2.jpg <br>
> ...<br>

<br>
<br>


2. Write the Code:

* Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to create a new Python file.

<br>
<br>

3. Run the Code:

* Save the Python file with an appropriate name, such as cat_vs_dog_classifier.py.
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the following command to execute the Python file:

  > python cat_vs_dog_classifier.py
