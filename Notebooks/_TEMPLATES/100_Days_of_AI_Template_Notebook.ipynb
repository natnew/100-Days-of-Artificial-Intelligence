It builds a tree-like model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents a class label. The model predicts by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on the input features. It is popular due to its interpretability and ability to handle categorical and numerical data. Decision trees are used when the relationship between features and the target variable is non-linear or when feature interactions are important.\n",
