                "As AI capabilities approach and exceed human expertise in narrow domains, it becomes difficult for humans to provide a correct reward signal. **Scalable Oversight** solves this by using AI to help humans. One powerful method is **AI Debate**: two agents argue for different conclusions, and a human 'judge' (assisted by the debate process) decides the winner. This surfaces flaws and evidence more effectively than single-agent responses.\n",
